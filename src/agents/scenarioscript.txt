Phase 0 — Set the stage

Click Hello Reliability Agent.
Say: “Are there any high failure rates or increasing trends across the fleet?”
Expect: thermostat trend called out; a couple of vehicles flagged (engine/transmission).

Say: “Which vehicles are most affected, and what’s the likely root cause?”
Expect: specific vehicles + “thermostat batch issue” hypothesis and a suggested action (inspections/PM tweak).

Phase 1 — Whole-week optimization (Scheduler)

Click Hello Scheduler Agent.
Say: “Optimize this week so all maintenance runs 08:00–17:00 and allow shifting ops tasks within ±1 day. Avoid ops overlaps.”
Expect: intent=PROPOSE with a preview (moved/scheduled/unscheduled).
Click Accept.
Watch: Gantt shifts; Demand and Resource cards recalc.

Say: “What moved vs the last plan?”
Expect: a moved list summary (QA report).

Phase 2 — Targeted maintenance moves + new WO

Pick a visible WO from the Gantt (e.g., WO-011).
Say: “Move WO-011 to start at 9:00 on 22 Aug (keep duration).”
Expect: intent=MUTATE with one MOVE_WORKORDER; preview shows only that change.
Click Accept.

Create inspection from reliability clue:
Say: “Create a 1h Thermostat Inspection on V012 for 22 Aug 10:00, Mechanic, priority Medium.”
Expect: intent=MUTATE with ADD_WORKORDER; preview shows the new WO.
Click Accept.

Check for conflicts:
Say: “What’s scheduled for V012 on 22 Aug?”
Expect: list of WOs/ops; note an ops clash if present.

Phase 3 — Operations control

Hover the conflicting ops bar on the Gantt for V012 to read its OpsID (e.g., OPS-123).
Say: “Cancel OPS-123 to resolve V012’s conflict.”
Expect: intent=MUTATE with CANCEL_OPS; preview shows ops removed.
Click Accept.
Watch: Gantt updates; Demand card and Resource card adjust.

Try a vehicle-wide reshuffle:
Say: “For V005, move all its maintenance to 22 Aug (business hours) and shift its ops tasks to other days this week without overlaps.”
Expect: intent=MUTATE with a small set (MOVE_WORKORDER + MOVE_OPS); preview reflects only V005.
Click Accept.

Phase 4 — Resources & constraints

Say: “Add technician T-EXTRA (Mechanic) with 8h availability each day this week.”
Expect: intent=MUTATE with ADD_TECH/SET_AVAILABILITY; preview then shows more scheduled work.
Click Accept.
Watch: Resource Utilisation rises appropriately.

Optional parts constraint:
Say: “Assume Thermostat is available by 24 Aug; re-optimize remaining maintenance inside business hours.”
Expect: ASSUME_PART_AVAILABLE + PROPOSE; preview reduces ‘unscheduled’.
Click Accept.

Phase 5 — Parts Interpreter (purchase suggestion)

Click Hello Parts Interpreter.
Say: “Draft a purchase order for thermostats to cover the fleet trend—use realistic SKU, supplier, lead time, cost, and a quantity rationale.”
Expect: a clean recommendation (SKU, supplier, lead time, unit cost, quantity + rationale).
(If you want WO context: “For WO-011, what parts should we stage?”)

Phase 6 — Quick wrap-up checks

Scheduler report: “Which maintenance couldn’t be scheduled?”
Expect: list based on preview/accepted state.

Reliability follow-up: “Given the thermostat trend, should we adjust PM or add a temporary inspection task across the fleet?”
Expect: specific, actionable suggestion (e.g., monthly check or supplier QA).

Tips if something doesn’t apply first time

If the Scheduler says an ID is unknown, ask: “List ops IDs for V012 this week.” or “Show unscheduled maintenance.” Then repeat the precise mutation by ID.

After any preview, Accept to apply; the Gantt + Demand/Resource cards will recompute.

Keep times and dates explicit to nudge MUTATE (e.g., “9:00 on 22 Aug”).

This sequence demonstrates: global optimization, targeted maintenance moves, creating/canceling work orders, moving/canceling ops by OpsID (no overlaps), changing resources, assuming parts availability, reliability insights → actions, and parts procurement—all with the agents leaning on the LLM and the UI reflecting changes live.
