Vehicles: vehicles_v3.json
(Down: V005 engine, V007 thermostat, V011 accident, V018 electrical)

Failures (6 months): failures_v3.json

V005 — increasing engine failures (sensor drift / oil pressure / overheat) → suggests a wiring/harness or thermal issue

V012 — increasing transmission failures (seal/fluid temp/slip) → suggests fluid loss/seal integrity

Thermostats spike across ~10 vehicles in the last 60 days (cooling: “thermostat stuck” open/closed)

V018 — intermittent electrical/performance issues (ECU reboot, CAN dropout, U0100, throttle lag) → points to ECU/grounding root cause

Work Orders (busy upcoming week): workorders_v3.json

V007 (DOWN): “Replace thermostat & coolant flush” (High, In Progress)

V005 (DOWN): “Engine wiring harness replacement” (High, In Progress) + “Engine sensor calibration” (Medium, Scheduled)

V011 (DOWN): accident repair (High, In Progress)

V018 (DOWN): “ECU replacement & reflash; inspect grounds” (High, In Progress)

V012 (rising transmission issues): “Transmission seal kit & fluid service” (Medium, Scheduled) + clutch pack inspection

Multiple thermostat replacements scheduled across other vehicles

Extra PMs + minor corrective items to keep the fleet busy, placed mostly at night (19:00+) to avoid ops

Done! I’ve regenerated condition.json to reflect the new reliability trends and the 4 “DOWN” cases.

What’s included

6 months of weekly snapshots (27 weeks) for all 20 vehicles × 5 subsystems = 2700 entries.

Trends baked in:

V005 (engine) — accelerating decline towards the present.

V012 (transmission) — accelerating decline towards the present.

Thermostat spike — vehicles with recent “thermostat stuck” failures show a sharper cooling decline in the last ~8 weeks.

V018 (electrical/ECU) — oscillating electrical condition with a mild downward trend and a low trough near the demo week.

V011 (accident) — lower engine/cooling condition near the demo week to reflect damage.

All DOWN vehicles have the affected subsystem pushed low in the week around the demo date.
